Project 2 Syntax Analyzer

Files Included:

1. f2.py (source file)
2. lexical.py (source file)
3. findcmnts.py (source file)
2. makefile
3. p2 (to run the source file)
4. test.txt (test file)
5. doc.txt (Documentation file) 
6. sample.txt (output file for the given test file) 

How to run the Program:

This program, since python language is used, does not need to execute make command.
This program can be executed by typing './p2 test'. 
Instead of my test file, users can use their own text or linux file as an command line argument.


General Discription:

The f2.py accepts a file from command line. 
It recognizes if the file is not provided in command line arguments, and prints a message.
It splits the content from given file into many sentences and store them in an array. 
One 'for loop' runs through that array, and calls a function named 'findcmnts' and 'lexical' with passing one line at a time. 
The 'lexical' uses the string that is returned by 'findcmnts' function- after removing comments including nested ones.
In 'findcmnts', there is a global variable named 'counter' which keeps track of the number of multiline comments.
Upon receiving string from 'findcmnts', the 'lexical' applies different regular expressions on the string, and 
	seperates them into tokens, and prints them.
	i.e id, num, operators, parenthesis, keywords, etc.
The 'lexical' uses the function 'findkeys' to seperate keywords from ids. 
It calls 'findkeys' whenever it finds an id, and 'findkeys' determines and prints if it is an id or a keyword.
Function 'findkeys' uses a global variable 'keywords' which has all the keywords stored in an array.
The 'lexical' recognizes all different tokens and error, if any, and it prints them one by one in the same order they came.
Upon receiving tokens from project 1, parse.py file goes through grammar rules of C- language via methods in class Parsing. 
It has dictionaries to hold on to the firsts and follows of the grammar rule non-terminals. 
The program uses the current token, firsts, and follows as a path to traverse through methods in the class. It has an object queue of class Queue to store all the tokens from project 1. 
Once the current token is on first index of the queue, and it is $, ACCEPT is printed. Otherwise, REJECT is printed.
