Project 5 Lex and YACC

Files Included:

1. p5.l (lex source file)
2. p5.y (yacc source file)
3. doc.txt (documentation file)
4. doc (same as doc.txt)
5. makefile 
6. test (test file)


How to run the Program:

This program first needs to be compiled with "make" command. This will generate executable "p5". 
"p5" can be run with a test file i.e ./p5 < test.


General Discription:


make command will generates following:	
	run the yacc file with command yacc -d p5.y, and it generates y.tab.c
	y.tab.c file is necessory to run the lex file
	it runs the lex file with command lex p5.l, and it generates lex.yy.c
	it then compiles both c files with gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c -o p5 command, 
	and generates executable p5.
The test file can have strings of characters.
The program will look for the strings that are part of the grammar from the project specification.
The program will output "ACCEPT" if the string is part of the grammar, 
			"REJECT" if the string is not part of the grammar.
